# GAMESPACE
GAMESPACE is an original dungeon crawler where you traverse a randomly generated maze searching for treasures and dodging traps along the way. We went out of our way to learn new technology and tools in order to build an exciting and original game while developing new skills, we hope you'll enjoy taking a look around!
